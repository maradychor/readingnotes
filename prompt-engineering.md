# Question 
**WHY** are social workers so underpaid?

Public Funding: Many social workers are employed by government agencies or non-profit organizations that heavily rely on public funding. Fluctuations in public budgets can impact the available resources for salaries.

# 100% Accurate

Public funding is a huge part of what holds programs together, programs that families in need can acess. That doesn't leave a lot of funding left over for employees, in fact there are people that volunteer and do this work for free.
